Safety and security have been one of the biggest concerns ever since. To mention a few, road accidents, criminal activities, etc.

Road accidents could have taken fewer lives, had the ambulances reached the spot little early on time. But this blame cannot be put on anybody, since a peson cannot be expected to work with complete efficiency since itâ€™s not possible for them to continuously coordinate with all the ambulances nearby so as to call the ambulance which could reach the spot at the earliest. Moreover, no one likes to get involved in police cases. But computers can do this task for us. It shall notify the nearest hospital along with the police without having any third person involved in the case.

Police cannot be everywhere, so we thought of this idea which would keep an eye on different places through CCTV cameras and notify the nearest police station about crimes going on at the place.

This project would also be able to identify some violation of rules, viz., crossing spped limits and other rules which go unnoticed in the absence of traffic police.
